## What are the key benefits of DevOps and how can we utilise them

### Key benefits

1 `Robustness`
System robustness is achieved by eliminating single points of failure in the system that would prevent successful transition.

2 `Ease of use`
Reducing repetitive manual work is critical in the DevOps methodology, which promotes automation throughout the digital lifecycle. Automation not only helps to create safer and faster releases but also supports the other DevOps principles. For instance, automation is done through scripting, which promotes visibility, thus culture and sharing among teams.


3 `Flexibility`
We have many ways to accomplish given task, we also have many different platforms and tools to make sure our application is well tested and our pipeline is automated.

4 `Cost effectivenes`
When we have DevOps in our team we can provide Cloud services, which will decrease cost as company does not have to rent dedicated building, hire person to look after that building and buy all equipment that is need.

## What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and private cloud



`PUBLIC CLOUD`
A public cloud is a type of computing in which a service provider makes resources available to the public via the internet. Resources vary by provider but may include storage capabilities, applications or virtual machines.


`HYBRID CLOUD`
Hybrid cloud is a solution that combines a private cloud with one or more public cloud services, with proprietary software enabling communication between each distinct service. A hybrid cloud strategy provides businesses with greater flexibility by moving workloads between cloud solutions as needs and costs fluctuate.

Hybrid cloud services are powerful because they give businesses greater control over their private data.


`PRIVATE CLOUD`
Private cloud is a computing model that offers a proprietary environment dedicated to a single business entity. As with other types of cloud computing environments, private cloud provides extended, virtualized computing resources via physical components stored on-premises or at a vendor's datacenter.

One of the chief advantages of a private cloud deployment is the enhanced degree of control offered to the organization. Because the private cloud is only accessible to a single business, that organization has the ability to configure the environment and manage it in a manner that is uniquely tailored to the specific computing needs of the company.


## What is Monolith Archtecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Archtecture



`Monolith Architecture`
In software engineering, a monolithic application describes a single-tiered software application in which the user interface and data access code are combined into a single program from a single platform.

`EXAMPLE`
Single page website



`2-tier Architecture`
A two-tier architecture is a software architecture in which a presentation layer or interface runs on a client, and a data layer or data structure gets stored on a server. Separating these two components into different locations represents a two-tier architecture, as opposed to a single-tier architecture.

`EXAMPLE`

Webstore application



`Micro-services Architecture`
Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations.

`EXAMPLE`

Website that provides best prices for travel tickets(train,flight etc.) and is collaborating with other websites. Beauty of that is every application is living is own life.
